# Changelog

Entries describe what an operator or user experiences, not what changed in the
code — `git log` already records that. Any required operator action is named
first; if there is none, the entry says so.

Versioning follows [ADR-0013](docs/adr/0013-versioning-and-releases.md): the
version answers "what must I do to upgrade?", not "how much changed?".

- **PATCH** — pull and restart, nothing else.
- **MINOR** — pull and restart; migrations run automatically.
- **MAJOR** — read this file first, there is something to do.

## Unreleased — 0.1.0-dev

Pre-alpha. Not usable yet, and not tagged. The bar for the first tag is listed
in ADR-0013.

**The server runs.** `docker compose up -d` starts an instance that applies its
migrations, serves `/api/health`, `/api/ready` and `/api/version`, accepts
WebSocket sync connections, and shuts down cleanly on SIGTERM without losing
unflushed edits.

Working so far:

- Documents as Yjs CRDTs with a rebuildable Postgres projection
- Real-time collaborative editing over a multiplexed WebSocket, with presence
- Accounts, sessions, invitations (single-use and multi-use links)
- Share links with view/comment/edit rights, subtree scope, optional password,
  and anonymous editing
- Revocation that takes effect on live connections, not just on reconnect
- Full-text search, indexed under both the workspace's language and a
  language-neutral configuration
- A maintenance job that prunes expired sessions, compacts document histories
  and revalidates open connections
- Backup and restore, verified end to end: dump, destroy the database, restore,
  and the documents still open
- Automatic upgrades — document formats migrate lazily when a page is opened,
  and the server refuses a downgrade instead of corrupting data

The document format was corrected before any data existed: the block tree now
lives in one ProseMirror fragment per page rather than one per block, which is
what makes multi-block selection possible at all
([ADR-0015](docs/adr/0015-one-fragment-per-page.md)).

Not working yet: there is no user interface. Everything above is reachable only
over the API and the sync protocol.

**Upgrades.** The intended experience for every release, major or not, is
`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. Database migrations and document
format migrations both run automatically; see
[ADR-0014](docs/adr/0014-automatic-upgrades.md) for what remains manual and why
it should be rare.

**Pre-1.0 warning.** Until 1.0, the persisted document format may change in a
minor release and a document migration may be required. Do not put anything you
care about into a pre-1.0 instance without a backup you have tested restoring.
